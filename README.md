# Counting Paths App

## Overview

The Counting Paths App is a C# application that allows you to count all valid ways of reaching a specific coordinate point in a 2D plane. You start from the origin (0, 0) and move towards the destination by taking steps either east (E) or north (N). The app provides functionality to calculate the number of valid paths to the destination and, optionally, display the routes for each valid path.

## Technologies Used

- **C#**: The primary programming language used to develop the Counting Paths App.

- **xUnit**: The testing framework used to create and run unit tests for the application to ensure its correctness and reliability.

## Features

- Calculate the number of valid paths to reach a specific coordinate point.
- Display routes for each valid path, optionally.
- Avoid taking exactly three consecutive steps in the same direction (optional task).

## Getting Started

To use the Counting Paths App, you'll need to have the following:

1. **Development Environment**: Ensure you have a C# development environment set up, such as Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code.

2. **xUnit Framework**: If you want to run and create unit tests, make sure you have the xUnit testing framework configured in your development environment.

3. **Your Code**: Copy and paste the provided code for the Counting Paths task into your C# project.

4. **Run the App**: You can call the `MyMethod` function with the desired input to count valid paths and display routes.

5. **Run Tests (Optional)**: If you want to run unit tests, set up and run the xUnit tests to validate the application's functionality.
